A [[https://github.com/getpelican/pelican][pelican]] plugin reading org-mode files and transforming them via pandoc.
Based heavily on [[https://github.com/liob/pandoc_reader][pandoc_reader]]

The existing =org_reader= plugin uses Emacs, which I didn't like. The metadata
handling also isn't very plesant, I think, with a fixed set of possible metadata
names. Last but not least, this plugin can add a highlighted version of the
source of the whole document, which then can be displayed in the blog.

* Requirements
- [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc][pandoc]]
- recommended
  - [[https://github.com/or/pandocfilter-pygments][pandocfilter-pygments]] to use Pygments for source blocks
  - [[https://github.com/or/pygments-orgmode-lexer][pygments-orgmode-lexer]] to highlight org-mode SRC blocks containing org-mode,
    required for full source generation of the document
  - [[http://pygments.org/][Pygments]] needed for both of the above

* Usage
Enable the plugin.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
PLUGINS = ['pandoc_org_reader']
#+END_SRC

You can set extra arguments for the =pandoc= call, which is also how you can use
=pandocfilter-pygments= to use Pygments instead of pandoc's highlighting.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
PANDOC_ORG_ARGS = [
    '--mathjax',
    '--filter=pandocfilter-pygments',
]
#+END_SRC

You can also set extensions for that call.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
PANDOC_ORG_EXTENSIONS = [
    '+hard_line_breaks',
    '-citations'
]
#+END_SRC

Finally, if you enable source generation, then Pygments will be used to generate
a highlighted HTML representation of the whole document, which will be available
as attribute in the pelican template: =article.source= or =page.source=.

This requires [[https://github.com/or/pygments-orgmode-lexer][pygments-orgmode-lexer]].
#+BEGIN_SRC python
PANDOC_ORG_GENERATE_SOURCE = True
#+END_SRC

* Metadata
The metadata must be given in the first block of org-mode properties. All
properties will be handed over to the template as attributes of the object:
=article.foobar= or =page.foobar=.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+TITLE: My new post
#+DATE: <2017-10-10 Tue>
#+CATEGORY: personal
#+AUTHOR: Oliver
#+SUMMARY: My latest musings
#+SLUG: my-new-post
#+TAGS: thoughts, ramblings

#+END_SRC
